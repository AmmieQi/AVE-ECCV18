Audio features are extracted using [vggish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset) and the audio-guided visual attention model was implemented highly based on [adaptive attention](https://github.com/jiasenlu/AdaptiveAttention). We thank the authors for sharing their codes.
